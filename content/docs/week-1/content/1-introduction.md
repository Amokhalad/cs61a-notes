# Introduction

terminal work:  
 - `python [filename.py]` runs a file
 - `python -i [filename.py]` runs a file and allows you to enter an enviornment where you can interact with your code.
 - (ctrl + l) = clears work in terminal but keeps you in session

**functions**:
 - you can assign functions to variables, so that the variables are not the function
   - f = max
 - you can even lose the function max
   - max = 7
 - to get add and mult functions:
   - `from operator import add, mul`
